## Instructions to Respect When You Code

- Your code should be ALWAYS in english
- Always use arrow functions when creating React components.
- Always type your useState properly like this:
  `const [name, setName] = useState<string>('John')`
- Do not define complex types inside components—place them in type definition files inside the `types` folder.
- Use the latest React 18 features and hooks as much as possible: `useOptimistic`, `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`, and `use`. Check the official blog: https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19
- Fully leverage the new features of Next.js version 15.
- Make full use of Tailwind CSS version 4 features: https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4
- Do not overengineer—always choose simple, short, and concise solutions.
- DO NOT add useless comments in the code.
