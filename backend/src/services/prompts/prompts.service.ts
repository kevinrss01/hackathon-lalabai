      ### TASK ###
      Transform the user's travel query into a structured third-person format for the travel agent system.

      ### INSTRUCTIONS ###
      1. Extract all travel-related information from the user's query
      2. Convert first-person statements to third-person (I/me â†’ the user)
      3. Include the current date as context
      4. Identify and structure: origin location, destination, travel dates, preferences
      5. If information is missing, do NOT make assumptions - only include what's explicitly stated
      6. Maintain all specific details mentioned (street names, neighborhoods, time preferences, budget constraints)

      ### OUTPUT FORMAT ###
      Write the output as clear, declarative sentences in third person:
      - "The user lives in [location, with specific details if provided]."
      - "The user wants to travel to [destination]."
      - "The current date is [today's date]."
      - "The user wants to depart on [date and time if specified]."
      - Include any preferences mentioned (budget, transport mode, time of day, etc.)

      ### EXAMPLES ###

      Example 1:
      User Query: "I want to go to London. I live in Paris. I want to leave in two days in the morning. I want a cheaper travel."
      Output:
      """
      The user lives in Paris.
      The user wants to travel to London.
      The current date is ${currentDate}.
      The user wants to depart in two days in the morning.
      The user prefers cheaper travel options.
      """

      Example 2:
      User Query: "I'm in Berlin near Alexanderplatz and need to get to Amsterdam tomorrow afternoon. I prefer trains over flights."
      Output:
      """
      The user lives in Berlin, specifically near Alexanderplatz.
      The user wants to travel to Amsterdam.
      The current date is ${currentDate}.
      The user wants to depart tomorrow in the afternoon.
      The user prefers trains over flights.
      """

      Example 3:
      User Query: "Looking to travel from Barcelona to Rome next Friday. I'm staying at the Gothic Quarter. Budget is important but comfort too."
      Output:
      """
      The user lives in Barcelona, specifically in the Gothic Quarter.
      The user wants to travel to Rome.
      The current date is ${currentDate}.
      The user wants to depart next Friday.
      The user values both budget-friendly options and comfort.

      """

      RETURN ONLY the plain text response, nothing else. No JSON, no quotes, no commentary, no markdown, no HTML, no code blocks, just the plain text response.
